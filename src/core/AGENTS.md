# Agent notes — IsaacTeleop `src/core` (index)

**CRITICAL:** The mandatory multi-file `AGENTS.md` preflight in **[`../../AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md)** applies here too. Before changing anything under `src/core/`, you must have read **this file**, **the repo root `AGENTS.md`**, and **every other `AGENTS.md` on the directory paths you will touch**. Do not skip any of them.

To see **all** `AGENTS.md` files in the IsaacTeleop repo, use the **`find` command (or `**/AGENTS.md` glob) documented in the repo root [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md)**—do not rely on a hand-maintained list in this file.

If work under **`src/core/`** went wrong—**user** correction, **pre-commit/CI** failure, or **repeated** same-class mistakes—you **must** follow the repo root **[`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md)** **Mandatory learning loop**: distill a short rule and **update** the **nearest** relevant `AGENTS.md` (this file or a package file) or **source comments** in the same session (including **delta vs `main`** scope).

- Async retargeting pacing behavior belongs on the pacing config objects; keep the worker focused on scheduling mechanics and avoid adding concrete pacing-mode or subclass branches there.
- Prefer coarse-grained async boundaries around an existing synchronous step before splitting DeviceIO/source polling away from graph execution; split internals only when a measured correctness or performance need justifies the extra thread-safety surface.
- In pipelined `TeleopSession`, `last_context` follows the returned completed frame; reset/control-transition events travel with that frame and must not force exact-current-frame waits. Use sync mode for exact current-frame behavior.
- Keep async retargeting comments short and local to invariants; user-facing pacing tuning guidance belongs in docs rather than long code docstrings.
- When changing `TeleopSession` retargeting execution defaults, update config, docs, and default-behavior tests together so opt-in vs. default semantics stay aligned.
- Preserve existing `TeleopSession` lifecycle flag semantics unless changing the public/context-manager contract intentionally; use tests to lock down cleanup details before altering them.
- After Python test or session-manager edits, let `ruff format`/pre-commit own wrapping and rerun the hook when it modifies files.
- **Sink/source `IDeviceIOSource` leaves are only discovered when reachable from a declared `OutputCombiner` output.** `TeleopSession._discover_sources` calls `pipeline.get_leaf_nodes()`, which walks back from the combiner's outputs. A sink/source whose only purpose is a side effect (haptic output, message-channel send) must therefore expose at least one output (a heartbeat boolean is the established pattern) **and** the user's combiner must include it. Every new sink/source of this shape needs both an explicit heartbeat output and a docstring warning that custom combiners must wire it up — silent no-discovery is the recurring footgun.
- **Run `clang-format -i` on touched C++ files before pushing.** The repo's `pre-commit` config runs `ruff` for Python but does **not** run `clang-format`; CI (`build-ubuntu.yml`) installs `clang-format-14` and rejects unformatted C++ as `-Wclang-format-violations`. Format locally with the system `clang-format` (matches CI's version 14) — e.g. `clang-format -i $(git diff --name-only main -- '*.cpp' '*.hpp' '*.h' '*.cc')` — and verify with `clang-format --dry-run --Werror <files>`.
