Quick Start
===========

This guide walks through running a teleoperation session with an XR headset using CloudXR. By the
end you will have the retargeting pipeline processing live hand/controller data and printing gripper
commands to the terminal.

.. contents:: Steps
   :local:
   :depth: 1
   :backlinks: none

.. _check-out-code-base:

1. Check out code base (for examples)
-------------------------------------

Clone the repository and enter the project directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/IsaacTeleop.git
   cd IsaacTeleop

As a quick start guide, we don't need to build the code base from source. However, we still need
to clone the repository for a couple quick samples to run.

.. _install-isaacteleop-pip-package:

2. Install the ``isaacteleop`` pip package
-------------------------------------------

In a new terminal, activate your preferred virtual or conda environment, then install the package
from PyPI (or from a local wheel if you built from source):

.. code-block:: bash

   # From PyPI
   pip install 'isaacteleop[cloudxr,retargeters]~=1.0.0' --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com

Instead of installing the package from PyPI, you can build from source and install the local wheel.
See :doc:`build_from_source/index` for more details.

.. dropdown:: ARM64 / aarch64 only (e.g. NVIDIA DGX Spark)

   PyPI does not publish pre-built ``nlopt`` wheels for ARM64, so the ``retargeters`` extra cannot
   be installed directly from PyPI
   (see `issue #452 <https://github.com/NVIDIA/IsaacTeleop/issues/452>`_). Follow the
   :ref:`aarch64 nlopt wheel build steps <aarch64-nlopt-wheel>` from the build-from-source guide
   first, then install ``isaacteleop`` with an additional ``--find-links``:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install 'isaacteleop[cloudxr,retargeters]~=1.0.0' \
          --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com \
          --find-links=/tmp/nlopt-wheels/

.. _run-cloudxr-server:

3. Configure CloudXR (optional)
-------------------------------

The teleop examples in this guide auto-launch the CloudXR runtime and its WSS
proxy for you through ``CloudXRLauncher`` when they connect — you do **not**
need to start the runtime in a separate terminal or source any environment file.
The first launch downloads the CloudXR Web Client SDK and asks you to review and
accept the EULA on the terminal; answer the prompt once and the acceptance is
remembered for subsequent runs.

The CloudXR runtime uses the ``auto-webrtc`` device profile by default
(Pico & Quest). For Apple Vision Pro it defaults to ``auto-native``. To
override settings, write a ``KEY=value`` env file and pass it to the example
with ``--cloudxr-env-config``:

.. code-block:: bash

   echo 'NV_DEVICE_PROFILE=auto-native' > custom.env
   python examples/teleop/python/gripper_retargeting_example_simple.py \
         --cloudxr-env-config ./custom.env

The teleop examples under ``examples/teleop/python/`` all register CloudXR's
launcher arguments through ``CloudXRLauncher.add_launcher_arguments()``, so
the same ``--cloudxr-env-config`` flag is available on each of them. (The ROS 2
example takes the equivalent ``cloudxr_env_config`` ROS parameter instead.)
To inspect the resolved settings after startup:

.. code-block:: bash

   cat ~/.cloudxr/run/cloudxr.env

.. note::

   If you prefer to run the runtime yourself in its own terminal — e.g. to keep
   the headset connection alive across example restarts, or to use launch modes
   like ``--host-client`` and ``--setup-oob`` — see
   :doc:`/references/cloudxr`.

     - ``true``, ``false``

.. _whitelist-firewall-ports:

4. Whitelist ports for Firewall
---------------------------------

CloudXR requires certain network ports to be open. Depending on your firewall configuration, you
might need to whitelist them manually.

.. dropdown:: Meta Quest and Pico headsets
   :open:

   For **Quest and Pico headsets** (web client), at the minimum, you need to whitelist the ports
   for the CloudXR runtime and wss proxy:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo ufw allow 47998/udp
      sudo ufw allow 49100,48322/tcp

   If you are running the web client from source (dev server), open both
   ports:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo ufw allow 8080,8443/tcp

.. dropdown:: Vision Pro client

   For **Vision Pro client**, you need to whitelist the ports for the CloudXR runtime and wss proxy:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo ufw allow 48010,48322/tcp
      sudo ufw allow 47998:48000,48005,48008,48012/udp

Please see the `CloudXR network setup`_ for more details for other network configurations (such as
running the CloudXR runtime and wss proxy in containerized environment; or using Vision Pro client).

.. _connect-xr-headset:

5. Connect an XR headset
------------------------

.. _connect-quest-pico:

.. dropdown:: Meta Quest, PICO headset, or desktop browser
   :open:

   No physical headset required for a quick test: open
   `https://nvidia.github.io/IsaacTeleop/client <https://nvidia.github.io/IsaacTeleop/client>`__
   in a **desktop browser** — IWER (Immersive Web Emulator Runtime) loads automatically and
   emulates a Meta Quest 3 headset.

   For a real headset, open the same URL in your **Meta Quest or PICO browser**.

   .. important::

      If using a physical headset, make sure it is updated to the latest firmware before connecting.
      Older firmware may ship an outdated WebXR runtime that fails to connect or streams with reduced
      functionality.

   .. note::

      Out of the box, Quest headsets stream at 72 FPS and 25 Mbps (Pico 4 Ultra at 90 FPS
      and 100 Mbps). You can raise both under **Advanced settings** in the control panel,
      up to 120 FPS and 200 Mbps, but on a typical 5 GHz Wi-Fi link the higher bitrates
      saturate the connection and you get reprojection judder within a few minutes. The
      defaults are the values that held stable over long sessions in our testing.

      The client remembers your settings between sessions. A saved profile other than
      ``Custom`` picks up the current recommended values on the next load, so updated
      defaults reach you without clearing browser storage. Switch the profile to
      ``Custom`` if you want your manual values to stick.

   .. note::

      If GitHub Pages is unreachable (corporate network, air-gapped machine), you can serve the web
      client locally from the CloudXR proxy and open ``https://<your-ip>:48322/client/`` instead of
      the GitHub Pages URL. Port 48322 is already whitelisted in step
      :ref:`whitelist-firewall-ports`. See :doc:`/references/oob_teleop_control` for how to serve the
      client from the proxy.

   .. tab-set::
      .. tab-item:: CloudXR web client

         .. figure:: ../_static/cloudxr-web-client-howto.png
            :alt: CloudXR web client usage instruction
            :align: center

            **Figure:** CloudXR web client usage instruction

      .. tab-item:: Privacy warning

         .. figure:: ../_static/cloudxr_accept_cert_not_private.png
            :alt: Browser privacy warning for self-signed certificate

            **Figure:** Browser privacy warning for self-signed certificate

      .. tab-item:: Certificate accepted

         .. figure:: ../_static/cloudxr_accept_cert_accepted.png
            :alt: Certificate accepted page

            **Figure:** Certificate accepted page

   As illustrated in the figure above, there are 3 steps to connect to your headset:

   1. Enter the IP address of the workstation running CloudXR
   2. Accept the self-signed SSL certificate, which was created automatically during :ref:`run-cloudxr-server`:

      - Click the **Click https://<ip>:48322/ to accept cert** link that appears on the page.
      - In the new tab, you will see a **"Your connection is not private"** warning. Click **Advanced**, then **Proceed to <ip> (unsafe)**.
      - Once accepted, the page will show **Certificate Accepted**. Navigate back to the CloudXR.js client page.
   3. Click **Connect** to begin teleoperation.

   .. note::
      For advanced usage and troubleshooting of CloudXR, see the `CloudXR documentation`_ for more
      details.

   .. dropdown:: Offline / air-gapped use

      On **first run**, the launcher syncs the published web client into
      ``~/.cloudxr/static-client/`` (override with ``TELEOP_WEB_CLIENT_STATIC_DIR``):
      ``index.html``, ``bundle.js``, and ``bundle.emulator.js``. Subsequent runs
      are offline once those files are cached.

      For a **true air-gapped machine**, copy the full ``build/`` output (or the
      matching directory from `nvidia.github.io/IsaacTeleop/client`_) into
      ``~/.cloudxr/static-client/`` on the air-gapped host before the first run.

   The source code for the web client is in the :code-dir:`deps/cloudxr/webxr_client/` directory.
   To build the web client from source, see :doc:`build_from_source/webxr`.

.. _connect-apple-vision-pro:

.. dropdown:: Apple Vision Pro

   For Apple Vision Pro, you will need to build and install the Isaac XR Teleop Sample Client. Follow
   the instructions in the `Isaac XR Teleop Sample Client for Apple Vision Pro`_ repository to build
   and install the sample client on your Apple Vision Pro.

   .. note::

      You will need v3.0.0 or newer of the `Isaac XR Teleop Sample Client for Apple Vision Pro`_
      to connect to Isaac Teleop.


.. _run-teleop-example:

6. Run a teleop example
------------------------

Run the simplified gripper retargeting example. This demonstrates the full
pipeline: reading XR controller input via CloudXR, retargeting it through the
``GripperRetargeter``, and printing the resulting gripper command values:

.. code-block:: bash

   python examples/teleop/python/gripper_retargeting_example_simple.py

Once running, squeeze the controller triggers on your XR headset to control
the gripper. You should see periodic status output:

.. code-block:: text

   ============================================================
   Gripper Retargeting - Squeeze triggers to control grippers
   ============================================================

   [  0.5s] Right: 0.00
   [  1.0s] Right: 0.73
   [  1.5s] Right: 1.00
   ...

The example runs for 20 seconds and then exits. To try other examples, see
``examples/teleop/python/`` — for instance:

- ``se3_retargeting_example.py`` — maps hand or controller poses to
  end-effector poses (absolute or relative)
- ``dex_bimanual_example.py`` — bimanual dexterous hand retargeting
- ``gripper_retargeting_example.py`` — full gripper example with more
  configuration options
