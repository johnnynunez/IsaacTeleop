Unified Stack for Sim & Real Teleoperation
-------------------------------------------

A single framework that works seamlessly across simulated and real-world robots, ensuring
streamlined device workflow and consistent data schemas.

Supported Input Devices
------------------------

Isaac Teleop provides a standardized interface for teleoperation devices, removing the need for
custom device integrations and ongoing maintenance. It supports multiple XR headsets and tracking
peripherals. Each device provides different input modes, which determine which retargeters and
control schemes are available. Easily extend support for additional devices through a plugin system;
see :ref:`device-interface-device-plugin` for details.

In addition to the fully integrated XR headsets, Isaac Teleop also supports standalone input
devices. Those devices are typically directly connected to the workstation where the Isaac Teleop
session is running via USB or Bluetooth. See :ref:`device-interface-device-plugin` for more details.

Targeted Robotics Embodiments
-----------------------------

- Retarget the standardized device outputs to different embodiments.
- `Reference retargeter implementations <https://github.com/NVIDIA/IsaacTeleop/tree/main/src/retargeters/>`_,
  including popular embodiments such as Unitree G1.
- `Retargeter tuning UI <https://github.com/NVIDIA/IsaacTeleop/tree/main/src/core/retargeting_engine_ui/python>`_ to facilitate
  live retargeter tuning.
