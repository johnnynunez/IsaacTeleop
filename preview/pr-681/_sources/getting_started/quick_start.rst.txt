Quick Start
===========

This guide walks through running a teleoperation session with an XR headset using CloudXR. By the
end you will have the retargeting pipeline processing live hand/controller data and printing gripper
commands to the terminal.

.. contents:: Steps
   :local:
   :depth: 1

.. _check-out-code-base:

1. Check out code base (Optional)
----------------------------------

Clone the repository and enter the project directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/IsaacTeleop.git
   cd IsaacTeleop

As a quick start guide, we don't need to build the code base from source. However, we still need
to clone the repository for a couple quick samples to run.

.. _install-isaacteleop-pip-package:

2. Install the ``isaacteleop`` pip package
-------------------------------------------

In a new terminal, activate your preferred virtual or conda environment, then install the package
from PyPI (or from a local wheel if you built from source):

.. code-block:: bash

   # From PyPI
   pip install 'isaacteleop[cloudxr,retargeters]~=1.0.0' --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com

Instead of installing the package from PyPI, you can build from source and install the local wheel.
See :doc:`build_from_source/index` for more details.

.. dropdown:: ARM64 / aarch64 only (e.g. NVIDIA DGX Spark)

   PyPI does not publish pre-built ``nlopt`` wheels for ARM64, so the ``retargeters`` extra cannot
   be installed directly from PyPI
   (see `issue #452 <https://github.com/NVIDIA/IsaacTeleop/issues/452>`_). Follow the
   :ref:`aarch64 nlopt wheel build steps <aarch64-nlopt-wheel>` from the build-from-source guide
   first, then install ``isaacteleop`` with an additional ``--find-links``:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install 'isaacteleop[cloudxr,retargeters]~=1.0.0' \
          --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com \
          --find-links=/tmp/nlopt-wheels/

.. _run-cloudxr-server:

3. Run CloudXR Server
---------------------

Start the CloudXR runtime. The first run downloads the CloudXR Web Client SDK
and asks you to review and accept the EULA:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m isaacteleop.cloudxr

To bypass the interactive EULA prompt (e.g. for CI or headless runs), pass the flag:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m isaacteleop.cloudxr --accept-eula

.. dropdown:: Optional launch modes

   The launcher supports three optional flags that can be combined to control
   how the headset connects and how the web client is delivered.

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 45 55

      * - Command
        - What it does
      * - ``python -m isaacteleop.cloudxr``
        - Plain: headset navigates to GitHub Pages URL over WiFi.
      * - ``python -m isaacteleop.cloudxr --host-client``
        - Serves the web client at ``https://<ip>:48322/client/`` via the WSS
          proxy. No separate port, no USB or TURN relay required. Useful when
          GitHub Pages is unreachable.
      * - ``python -m isaacteleop.cloudxr --setup-oob``
        - OOB hub + CDP automation: opens the browser on the headset and
          auto-clicks CONNECT over USB adb. Client URL is GitHub Pages.
      * - ``python -m isaacteleop.cloudxr --setup-oob --host-client``
        - OOB hub + CDP with client at ``/client/`` on the WSS proxy
          (air-gapped / proxy use).
      * - ``python -m isaacteleop.cloudxr --setup-oob --usb-local``
        - All traffic over USB: adb-reverse + coturn TURN relay + loopback
          HTTPS. Requires ``coturn`` and a WiFi-associated headset.

   ``--usb-local`` requires ``--setup-oob``.  See
   :doc:`/references/oob_teleop_control` for full OOB documentation.

You should see output similar to:

.. figure:: ../_static/cloudxr-run-output.png
   :alt: CloudXR run output
   :align: center

   **Figure:** CloudXR run output

.. important::

   Keep this terminal open — CloudXR must stay running for the duration of the session. Open a
   **new terminal** for the remaining steps.

   Also take note of the ``source /home/dev/.cloudxr/run/cloudxr.env`` path it mentioned in the
   output. You will need to source it in step :ref:`load-cloudxr-environment-variables`.

.. dropdown:: CloudXR configurations (optional)

   The CloudXR runtime uses the ``auto-webrtc`` device profile by default (Pico & Quest). For
   Apple Vision Pro it defaults to ``auto-native``.

   To inspect the active settings after startup:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cat ~/.cloudxr/run/cloudxr.env

   To override settings, create an env file and pass it at startup:

   .. code-block:: bash

      echo 'NV_DEVICE_PROFILE=auto-native' > custom.env
      python -m isaacteleop.cloudxr --cloudxr-env-config=./custom.env

   .. list-table:: Environment variables
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 25 15 35 25

      * - Variable
        - Default
        - Description
        - Values
      * - ``NV_DEVICE_PROFILE``
        - ``auto-webrtc``
        - Device profile
        - ``auto-webrtc``, ``auto-native``, ``Quest3``, ``AppleVisionPro``
      * - ``NV_CXR_ENABLE_PUSH_DEVICES``
        - ``true``
        - Push device overseer for hand tracking
        - ``true``, ``false``
      * - ``NV_CXR_FILE_LOGGING``
        - ``true``
        - File-based logging (disable to print to console)
        - ``true``, ``false``

.. _whitelist-firewall-ports:

4. Whitelist ports for Firewall
---------------------------------

CloudXR requires certain network ports to be open. Depending on your firewall configuration, you
might need to whitelist them manually.

.. dropdown:: Meta Quest and Pico headsets
   :open:

   For **Quest and Pico headsets** (web client), at the minimum, you need to whitelist the ports
   for the CloudXR runtime and wss proxy:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo ufw allow 47998/udp
      sudo ufw allow 49100,48322/tcp

   If you are running the web client from source (dev server), open both
   ports:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo ufw allow 8080,8443/tcp

.. dropdown:: Vision Pro client

   For **Vision Pro client**, you need to whitelist the ports for the CloudXR runtime and wss proxy:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo ufw allow 48010,48322/tcp
      sudo ufw allow 47998:48000,48005,48008,48012/udp

Please see the `CloudXR network setup`_ for more details for other network configurations (such as
running the CloudXR runtime and wss proxy in containerized environment; or using Vision Pro client).

.. _connect-xr-headset:

5. Connect an XR headset
------------------------

.. _connect-quest-pico:

.. dropdown:: Meta Quest, PICO headset, or desktop browser
   :open:

   No physical headset required for a quick test: open the `nvidia.github.io/IsaacTeleop/client`_
   URL in a **desktop browser** — IWER (Immersive Web Emulator Runtime) loads automatically and
   emulates a Meta Quest 3 headset.

   For a real headset, open the same URL in your **Meta Quest or PICO browser**.

   .. important::

      If using a physical headset, make sure it is updated to the latest firmware before connecting.
      Older firmware may ship an outdated WebXR runtime that fails to connect or streams with reduced
      functionality.

   .. note::

      If GitHub Pages is unreachable (corporate network, air-gapped machine), start the server with
      ``--host-client`` in step :ref:`run-cloudxr-server` and open
      ``https://<your-ip>:48322/client/`` instead of the GitHub Pages URL. Port 48322 is already
      whitelisted in step :ref:`whitelist-firewall-ports`.

   .. tab-set::
      .. tab-item:: CloudXR web client

         .. figure:: ../_static/cloudxr-web-client-howto.png
            :alt: CloudXR web client usage instruction
            :align: center

            **Figure:** CloudXR web client usage instruction

      .. tab-item:: Privacy warning

         .. figure:: ../_static/cloudxr_accept_cert_not_private.png
            :alt: Browser privacy warning for self-signed certificate

            **Figure:** Browser privacy warning for self-signed certificate

      .. tab-item:: Certificate accepted

         .. figure:: ../_static/cloudxr_accept_cert_accepted.png
            :alt: Certificate accepted page

            **Figure:** Certificate accepted page

   As illustrated in the figure above, there are 3 steps to connect to your headset:

   1. Enter the IP address of the workstation running CloudXR
   2. Accept the self-signed SSL certificate, which was created automatically during :ref:`run-cloudxr-server`:

      - Click the **Click https://<ip>:48322/ to accept cert** link that appears on the page.
      - In the new tab, you will see a **"Your connection is not private"** warning. Click **Advanced**, then **Proceed to <ip> (unsafe)**.
      - Once accepted, the page will show **Certificate Accepted**. Navigate back to the CloudXR.js client page.
   3. Click **Connect** to begin teleoperation.

   .. note::
      For advanced usage and troubleshooting of CloudXR, see the `CloudXR documentation`_ for more
      details.

   .. dropdown:: Offline / air-gapped use

      On **first run**, the launcher fetches ``index.html`` and ``bundle.js`` from GitHub Pages and
      caches them in ``~/.cloudxr/static-client/`` (override with
      ``TELEOP_WEB_CLIENT_STATIC_DIR``). Subsequent runs are fully offline.

      For a **true air-gapped machine**, pre-stage the two files before the first run — copy them
      from ``https://nvidia.github.io/IsaacTeleop/client/`` on a networked host, then transfer the
      ``~/.cloudxr/static-client/`` directory to the air-gapped machine.

   The source code for the web client is in the :code-dir:`deps/cloudxr/webxr_client/` directory.
   To build the web client from source, see :doc:`build_from_source/webxr`.

.. _connect-apple-vision-pro:

.. dropdown:: Apple Vision Pro

   For Apple Vision Pro, you will need to build and install the Isaac XR Teleop Sample Client. Follow
   the instructions in the `Isaac XR Teleop Sample Client for Apple Vision Pro`_ repository to build
   and install the sample client on your Apple Vision Pro.

   .. note::

      You will need v3.0.0 or newer of the `Isaac XR Teleop Sample Client for Apple Vision Pro`_
      to connect to Isaac Teleop.


.. _load-cloudxr-environment-variables:

6. Load CloudXR environment variables
--------------------------------------

Open a new terminal and source the CloudXR environment variables posted from the CloudXR runtime in
:ref:`run-cloudxr-server`:

Source the setup script so that the OpenXR runtime points to CloudXR:

.. code-block:: bash

   source ~/.cloudxr/run/cloudxr.env

.. important::

   Make sure to run the rest of the commands in the same terminal. Or if have to open a new
   terminal, source the CloudXR environment variables again.

.. _run-teleop-example:

7. Run a teleop example
------------------------

Run the simplified gripper retargeting example. This demonstrates the full
pipeline: reading XR controller input via CloudXR, retargeting it through the
``GripperRetargeter``, and printing the resulting gripper command values:

.. code-block:: bash

   python examples/teleop/python/gripper_retargeting_example_simple.py

Once running, squeeze the controller triggers on your XR headset to control
the gripper. You should see periodic status output:

.. code-block:: text

   ============================================================
   Gripper Retargeting - Squeeze triggers to control grippers
   ============================================================

   [  0.5s] Right: 0.00
   [  1.0s] Right: 0.73
   [  1.5s] Right: 1.00
   ...

The example runs for 20 seconds and then exits. To try other examples, see
``examples/teleop/python/`` — for instance:

- ``se3_retargeting_example.py`` — maps hand or controller poses to
  end-effector poses (absolute or relative)
- ``dex_bimanual_example.py`` — bimanual dexterous hand retargeting
- ``gripper_retargeting_example.py`` — full gripper example with more
  configuration options
