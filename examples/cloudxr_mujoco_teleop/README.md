# CloudXR MuJoCo Teleop Visualization Examples

Live MuJoCo viewers for the OpenXR pose streams arriving from IsaacTeleop —
typically while a Vive headset streams through NVIDIA CloudXR. The samples
ship with a generic HMD and Vive Focus 3 (controllers) meshes and textures
in `vive_assets/`, but the pipeline they consume is runtime-agnostic and
works with any CloudXR / OpenXR-compatible HMD.

| Example | What it shows |
|---------|---------------|
| `visualize_poses_mujoco_example.py` | HMD + left/right controller as textured mocap bodies. |
| `visualize_hands_mujoco_example.py`  | Both hands as 26-joint skeletons (spheres + capsule bones), with the HMD as optional context. |

## Prerequisites

Assumes IsaacTeleop is already built and installed in this tree.

1. **[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** (one-time install):
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```
   On first launch, `uv run` fetches this example's Python dependencies
   (`mujoco`, `numpy`, `scipy` — see `pyproject.toml`) into an isolated
   environment.

2. **CloudXR environment loaded**, so OpenXR resolves to the CloudXR
   runtime. Source the setup script that ships with your CloudXR install:
   ```bash
   source ~/.cloudxr/run/cloudxr.env
   ```
   The CloudXR runtime should be running with the headset connected before
   launching the examples below.

Close the viewer window or press `Ctrl+C` to quit either example. No time
limit, no recording.

## Examples

### `visualize_poses_mujoco_example.py`

HMD + left + right controller, each rendered as a textured mesh mocap body.

```bash
uv run visualize_poses_mujoco_example.py
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--assets-dir DIR` | `./vive_assets` | Where to find the device meshes / textures. |
| `--pose {grip,aim}` | `grip` | Which controller pose drives the mesh — natural "hold" pose or the aim ray. |
| `--debug` | off | Print `mocap_pos` for all three devices once per second. |

### `visualize_hands_mujoco_example.py`

Both hands as 26-joint skeletons drawn directly into `viewer.user_scn` each
frame (left = cyan, right = warm orange) — avoids paying for 52 mocap bodies
in the model. The HMD is shown as context using the same mesh + texture as
the poses example.

```bash
uv run visualize_hands_mujoco_example.py
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--no-head` | off | Skip the head mesh — only draw the hand skeletons. |
| `--debug` | off | Print per-hand valid-joint counts once per second. |

Hand tracking obviously requires hand poses to actually arrive in the
stream. If only controllers are tracked, both hands stay empty and only the
HMD will be visible.

## Viewer controls (both examples)

- **Mouse wheel** — zoom. The free camera's `lookat` is rewritten to the
  headset position every frame, so zoom always converges on the head.
- **Left-click drag** — orbit around the headset.
- **Right-click drag** — pan (the next frame's auto-recentre snaps back).
- `[` / `]` — cycle cameras: `free` → fixed cameras (the poses example
  also ships `play_area` and a `follow_head` camera that rides behind/above
  the HMD via `mode="trackcom"`).
- Side panels are hidden by default; press `Tab` to toggle them back if you
  need MuJoCo's built-in inspector / rendering options.

```

The bundled meshes are a generic HMD and the Vive Focus 3 controllers.
Each OBJ carries UV coordinates; the matching `*_color.png` is bound via
MJCF `<material texture="..."/>`, so missing `.mtl` files are not a
problem.

Both examples share `vive_assets/` — the hands example reuses the HMD mesh
+ texture for its context body.

If any asset is missing each example degrades gracefully: a mesh-less
device falls back to a coloured primitive box; a textureless mesh falls
back to a solid colour.

## Notes for adaptation

These are also documented at the top of each script.

- **Coordinate frames.** OpenXR is right-handed, Y-up, -Z forward; MuJoCo's
  default is right-handed, Z-up. Every incoming pose is rotated by +90°
  about X, and the quaternion (for the pose mocap bodies) is reordered
  from `xyzw` (OpenXR / scipy) to `wxyz` (MuJoCo).
- **Mesh-frame fix.** OBJ files are not modelled in the OpenXR pose frame.
  Both scripts apply a per-device static rotation (the geom's local `quat`)
  to align each mesh with its tracked pose. The shipped values
  (`(0, 0, 180)` for the HMD, `(0, 90, 0)` for the controllers) were tuned
  visually for the bundled generic HMD and Vive Focus 3 controllers —
  **re-tune them for your own meshes.**
- **Reference space.** Both samples assume a stage / floor-relative
  reference space, so the headset reports its real height (`Y ≈ 1.5 m`).
  With a local / head-relative reference space the headset always reads as
  the origin and everything will collapse to floor level.
