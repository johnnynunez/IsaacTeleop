Egocentric Hand Reconstruction
==============================

Automated pipeline for 4D hand and camera pose reconstruction from egocentric
videos. Integrates ViPE and Dyn-HaMR in containerized environments.

Video Capture
---------------------------

To capture egocentric video with an OAK camera, see the
`OAK camera plugin <https://nvidia.github.io/IsaacTeleop/main/device/oak.html>`_ documentation.

Setup
-----

System Requirement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- OS: Ubuntu 24.04
- GPU: NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada or L40
- Memory: 100GB (for a reference 30s video, more for longer)
- Storage: 100GB

Prepare data files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Place required files in the ``outputs/`` directory.

.. code-block:: text

   ...
   ├── doc/
   ├── docker/
   ├── scripts/
   ├── ...
   └── outputs/
       ├── MANO_RIGHT.pkl
       └── BMC/
           └── *.npy

**MANO model** (required):

- Download from: https://mano.is.tue.mpg.de/
- Place: ``outputs/MANO_RIGHT.pkl``

**BMC data** (required):

- Follow the README in https://github.com/MengHao666/Hand-BMC-pytorch to
  generate (until the step ``python calculate_bmc.py``)
- Place all ``.npy`` files in: ``outputs/BMC/``

.. note::

   The Hand-BMC-pytorch repository is no longer actively maintained, so parts
   of its setup may not work out-of-the-box on newer systems. At the time of
   writing, the ``environment.yml`` pins PyTorch to a specific build
   (``py3.7_cuda10.0.130_cudnn7.6.2_0``) that may no longer be available on
   Conda channels or compatible with current hardware. If Conda fails to
   resolve the environment, one workaround is to relax the pins in
   ``environment.yml``:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      # Before
      - pytorch==1.2.0=py3.7_cuda10.0.130_cudnn7.6.2_0
      - torchvision==0.4.0=py37_cu100

      # After
      - pytorch=1.2.0
      - torchvision=0.4.0

   This fix reflects the state of the upstream repo at the time of writing and
   may need to be adjusted as the ecosystem evolves.

Build Docker images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   ./docker/vipe.sh build
   ./docker/dynhamr.sh build

.. note::

   Building these Docker images pulls third-party source code, libraries, and
   pre-trained model weights from external repositories. These components are
   subject to their own respective licenses, which may include restrictions on
   use, modification, or redistribution. It is the user's responsibility to
   review and comply with all applicable third-party licenses before building,
   using, or distributing these images. Refer to each Dockerfile for the
   specific sources pulled during the build.

Hand Reconstruction
-------------------

Run complete reconstruction (ViPE + Dyn-HaMR) with a single command:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Using a local video file
   ./scripts/run_reconstruction.sh path/to/your_video.mp4

   # Using a remote video file
   ./scripts/run_reconstruction.sh s3://path/to/your_video.mp4

The script accepts either a **local file path** or a ``s3://`` **URL**
pointing to a video on a S3-compatible cloud storage. When a URL is provided,
the video is automatically downloaded to the ``outputs/`` directory before
processing begins.

To use a remote video, set the following environment variables for
credentials:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 28 12 60

   * - Variable
     - Required
     - Description
   * - ``ACCESS_KEY_ID``
     - Yes
     - Your S3 access key ID
   * - ``SECRET_ACCESS_KEY``
     - Yes
     - Your S3 access key
   * - ``BUCKET_REGION``
     - No
     - Region (default: ``us-east-1``)
   * - ``BUCKET_ENDPOINT_URL``
     - No
     - Custom endpoint for S3-compatible storage

By default, the pipeline reads data files from and writes results to the
``outputs/`` directory. Set ``OUTPUTS_DIR`` to use a different location:

.. code-block:: bash

   OUTPUTS_DIR=/path/to/outputs ./scripts/run_reconstruction.sh path/to/your_video.mp4

The pipeline will:

1. Copy or download the video to ``outputs/``.
2. Run ViPE to estimate camera poses.
3. Run Dyn-HaMR for hand reconstruction.
4. Save all results to ``outputs/logs/``.

View results
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   # List results
   ls outputs/logs/video-custom/<DATE>/<VIDEO_NAME>*/

   # View visualization
   vlc outputs/logs/video-custom/<DATE>/<VIDEO_NAME>*/*_grid.mp4
