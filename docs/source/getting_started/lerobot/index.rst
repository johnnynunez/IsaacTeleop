LeRobot and SO-101
==================

With Isaac Teleop, we got an end-to-end data collection and training pipeline for SO-101 in both sim and real teleoperation.

The `SO-101 <https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100>`_ is a low-cost, open-source robot arm
that has become a popular platform in the `LeRobot <https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot>`_
community. Isaac Teleop lets you drive an SO-101 from more than one teleoperation device to collect
demonstrations — in simulation with `Isaac Lab <https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab>`_ and on real
hardware with `SO-101 support in LeRobot <https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/en/so101>`_ — then train a GR00T N1.7
manipulation policy on the result and close the loop from sim to real.

The same SO-101 task runs in Isaac Lab and on the real arm, each recording a LeRobot dataset. The two
panels below stack on narrow screens and sit side by side on wider ones, and can be replaced
independently:

End-to-end workflow
-------------------

The same SO-101 embodiment runs in simulation and on real hardware, so a single workflow carries
you from teleoperation to a deployed policy:

#. **Teleoperate and collect.** Drive the SO-101 with the :doc:`XR controller or the SO-101 Leader
   <devices>` and record demonstrations — in :doc:`real <data_collection_real>` and in
   :doc:`simulation <data_collection_sim>`. Both produce datasets in the LeRobot format.

#. **Train.** Fine-tune a :doc:`GR00T N1.7 <training_groot>` policy on the collected dataset.

#. **Deploy.** Take the policy from sim to real — see the `Sim-to-Real SO-101 learning path`_ —
   addressing the sim-to-real gap with domain randomization, sim/real co-training, and
   actuator-gap compensation.
